# Meeting Planner

### Brief Project Description

Web-service created for employees of companies and organizations, allowing them to easily team up and distribute roles between each other, arrange team meetings and invite co-members to them. Each employee receives a personal meeting invitation, which they can either accept or reject. If the invitation is rejected, it is necessary to suggest another, more suitable date and time. Depending on the number of positive invitation responses, the meeting may be canceled or postponed.
